### Multilanguage React Template

This is a template created to show the implementation of internationalization within an existing project. The Github repository mostly relies on already existing
examples written in the documentation of the mentioned packages and in the examples of other fellow developers. However, attention was paid to the simplest
possible presentation of the implementation through easy-to-understand representations, cool images and translations.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
