### Multilanguage React Template

This is a template created to show the implementation of internationalization within an existing project. It mostly relies on already existing examples written
in the documentation of the mentioned packages. Here you can find easy-to-understand representations, cool images and translations.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
